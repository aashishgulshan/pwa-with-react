# React Progressive Web Application (PWA) Starter

## Overview

This is a starter template for building Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) using React. PWAs are web applications that provide a native app-like experience to users, including offline functionality, push notifications, and more. This template includes the necessary configurations and best practices to help you get started quickly.

## Features

- **React**: Built with the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Service Worker**: Utilizes a service worker for caching and providing offline functionality.
- **Manifest File**: Includes a manifest file for configuring the PWA experience on mobile devices.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Routing**: Configured with a routing solution for seamless navigation in the application.
- **Webpack**: Bundles and optimizes your code for production.
- **Linting**: Integrated with ESLint for maintaining code quality.
- **Testing**: Configured with Jest and React Testing Library for testing components.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-pwa-starter.git
    cd react-pwa-starter
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser.

4. **Build for Production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a `build` folder with optimized and minified production-ready code.

## Configuration

- **Service Worker:**

    The service worker is configured in the `src/service-worker.js` file. Customize caching strategies, offline behavior, and other service worker features here.

- **Manifest File:**

    Update the `public/manifest.json` file to configure the appearance and behavior of the PWA on mobile devices.

- **Environment Variables:**

    Update the `.env` file for environment-specific configurations. For example, you can set the `REACT_APP_API_URL` for API endpoints.

## Testing

Run tests using:

```bash
npm test
